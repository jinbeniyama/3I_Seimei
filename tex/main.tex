\begin{abstract}
3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N$_1$ (ATLAS), is the third interstellar object (IEO) discovered in July 2025.
IEOs are particularly interesting because characterizing their physical properties helps us understand and test our knowledge of Solar System formation.
Several quick response observations of 3I/ATLAS were performed during the first few days after the discovery, and various results, such as reflectance spectra, have been reported.
We performed simultaneous visible spectrophotometry of 3I/ATLAS from data taken using the TriColor CMOS Camera and Spectrograph (TriCCS) on the Seimei 3.8~m telescope.
The Seimei/TriCCS observations of 3I/ALTAS were obtained in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS system on UTC July 15, 2025.
Our lightcurves show no significant variations during the 2.3~h observation, which is in good agreement with previous studies.
Visible color indices of 3I/ATLAS, \gr, \ri, and \rz suggest it has a red surface similar to, or slightly redder than, that of D-type asteroids.
Continuous observations of 3I/ATLAS before and after its perihelion passage in October 2025 are desired to investigate its physical properties.

\section{Introduction}
% 1. Interstellar comet
Small bodies formed outside of the Solar System but are passing through it are called interstellar objects (IEO) or interstellar interlopers (e.g., \cite{Jewitt2023} for review).
IEOs are particularly of interest 
because their physical characteristics can reveal valuable information about the early history of the Solar System.
The first IEO 1I/`Oumuamua was discovered by the Pan-STARRS survey \citep{Chambers2016} on October 19, 2017 \citep{Meech2017}, while the second IEO 2I/Borisov was discovered by G. Borisov on August 30, 2019.
Since 2019, no IEOs had been discovered for about six years, and our knowledge of IEOs remained limited due to the small sample size.

On July 1st, 2025, the third IEO 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N$_1$ (ATLAS), was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS, \cite{Tonry2018}) in Chile \citep{Denneau2025}.
Soon after the discovery, weak cometary activity was reported by several observers across the world.
Initial characterizations were performed worldwide using instruments such as the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope  \citep{Seligman2025_3I}, the Very Large Telescope \citep{Seligman2025_3I, Opitom2025_3I, Alvarez-Candal2025_3I}, 
Kottamia Astronomical Observatory 1.88-m telescope, Palomar 200-inch telescope, Apache Point Observatory Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-m telescope \citep{Bolin2025_3I, Belyakov2025_3I}, the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias \citep{Marcos2025_3I}, the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility \citep{Kareta2025_3I}, and several smaller telescopes.
% Yang, Bing Gemini + IRTF?
Also, the 37 detections from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory were reported \citep{Chandler2025_3I}.
The results of existing observations are diverse, with different spectra reported, making interpretation challenging.
Independent and reliable measurements are required before the perihelion passage in October 2025, when the comet could become more active.

In this letter, we present the results of simultaneous visible spectrophotometry of \I.
The observations were conducted on July 15, 2025, when \I was at a heliocentric distance of 4.03~au.
We describe the observations and data reduction in section \ref{sec:obs}, and present the results and discussion in section \ref{sec:res}.
We present the conclusion in section \ref{sec:conc}.

\section{Observations}\label{sec:obs}
Visible spectrophotometric data of \I were acquired on July 15, 2025.
A summary of the observational conditions is provided in table \ref{tab:obs}.
The predicted $V$ band magnitudes in table \ref{tab:obs} were obtained from NASA JPL Horizons \footnote{\url{https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons}} using the Python package astroquery \citep{Ginsburg2019}.
Observations of \I were carried out with the TriColor CMOS Camera and Spectrograph (TriCCS) mounted on the 3.8~m Seimei Telescope \citep{Kurita2020} 
under a single-epoch DDT program (PI: Jin Beniyama).
The telescope is located at the Kyoto University Okayama Observatory (133.5967$^\circ$ E, 34.5769$^\circ$ N, and 355~m in altitude).
Three-band imaging was simultaneously conducted using combinations of Pan-STARRS ($g$, $r$, $i$) and ($g$, $r$, $z$) filters.
The instrument covers a field of view of $12.6\arcmin \times 7.5\arcmin$ with a pixel scale of 0.350~arcsec~pixel$^{-1}$.

At the time, \I had a geocentric distance of about 4.03~au and a heliocentric distance of about 3.11~au.
The phase angle of \I was approximately 7.1~deg on July 15, 2025.
The apparent sky motion of \I was about 1.5~arcsec~min$^{-1}$.
The percent of the Moon illuminated was about 76\%, and the lunar elongation was about 87-88~deg.
The sky was clear, and the seeing measured by using in-field stars was 2.2--2.6~arcsec in the $r$ band.

We obtained images in the non-sidereal tracking mode during the observations of \I.
Also, we obtained sidereal tracking images to measure the seeing.
Exposure times were set to 60~s for all observations.
We performed standard image reduction, including bias subtraction, dark subtraction, and flat-fielding.
The astrometry of in-field sources from the Gaia Data Release 2 was performed using the astrometry.net software \citep{Lang2010}.

To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of \I while avoiding the elongations of their images, we performed mean stacking prior to photometry, as shown in figure \ref{fig:cutout}.
Ten successive 60~s exposures were stacked to obtain images with an effective exposure times of 600~s.
The two stacked frames, which overlap with the bright stars, were excluded from the analysis (see table \ref{tab:phot}).
A typical readout time of the CMOS sensors on TriCCS is 0.4~milliseconds,
which is negligibly small compared to the exposure time of 60~s.
We also stacked frames using the World Coordinate System (WCS) of images corrected with the surrounding sources to suppress the elongations of the images of reference stars.

A custom pipeline to perform photometry using the same instrument was developed and used in the previous papers \citep{Beniyama2023a, Beniyama2023b, Beniyama2023c, Beniyama2024, Beniyama2025b}.
The field of 3I on that night was crowded with a galactic coordinate of $(l, b) = (7.7^{\circ}, 7.7^{\circ})$.
Thus, we developed and used a modified pipeline to analyze images of 3I.
Circular aperture photometry was performed on both \I and the reference stars using the SExtractor-based Python package sep. 
% BG subtraction
The local background estimated as a median value of the $85\times85$~pix cutout image centered at the 3I or a reference star was subtracted before photometry.
The aperture radii were set to 12~pix for reference stars, and were examined for 3I (see section \ref{sec:res}).
Photometry of \I was conducted on non-sidereally stacked frames, while reference stars were measured using sidereal stacked frames.

All images were calibrated using Pan-STARRS catalog Data Release 2 \citep{Chambers2016}.
Since the field was crowded, we manually selected reference stars that are far from any other sources.
Extended sources, possible quasars as well as variable stars were removed using objinfoflag and objfilterflag in the Pan-STARRS catalog.
In total, 15 reference stars that met the following criteria were used in the analysis:
$0.0 \leq (g-r)_{\mathrm{PS}} \leq 1.1$ and $0.0 \leq (r-i)_{\mathrm{PS}} \leq 0.8$, where $(g-r)_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $(r-i)_{\mathrm{PS}}$ are colors in the Pan-STARRS system.
The typical uncertainty in the magnitude zero point is approximately 0.05~mag

\section{Results and discussion}\label{sec:res}
% 1. Lightcurves
The lightcurves of \I extracted from photometry using a fixed aperture of 6~pix, corresponding to approximately 5000~km from \I, are shown in figure \ref{fig:lc}.
We tested a range of aperture sizes from 5 to 12~pixels and found that the resulting relative brightnesses were nearly identical across this range, except for the largest apertures, where background contamination became non-negligible.
Observations in the $g$ and $r$ bands spanned approximately 2.3 hours, yielding lightcurves that exhibit variations with amplitudes of roughly 0.3~mag.
However, we interpret these variations as likely being artifacts rather than rotational variation due to changes in its cross-section.
The relatively flat lightcurves of \I are consistent with \citet{Seligman2025_3I}, 
which found no periodicity is apparent in the intensive time-series observations between July 2 and July 4, 2025. 
\citet{Kareta2025_3I} also reported the absence of rotational variation from photometry spanning over three hours obtained with the IRTF.

% 2. Colors
As noted above, the lightcurve variations in figure \ref{fig:lc} are likely
instrumental artifacts, while they appear to be synchronized across all bands, suggesting that reliable color measurements can still be obtained.
Colors of \I were computed for each 600-second stacked frame.
We examined a range of aperture sizes from 5 to 12~pixels and found the resulting color indices were identical within the uncertainties as shown in figure \ref{fig:radcol}.
We derived the median values and standard deviations of the color indices to be \gr, \ri, and \rz using a fixed aperture of 6~pix.
We summarize the derived colors of \I with those reported in \citet{Bolin2025_3I} in table \ref{tab:col}.
We converted colors from \citet{Bolin2025_3I} in the SDSS system into the Pan-STARRS system using the transformation equations from \cite{Tonry2012}.
We computed the propagated uncertainties of the colors in the Pan-STARRS system with the photometric errors and uncertainties in transformations.
%Table \ref{tab:col} also includes colors of \I from xxx.

% 3. Reflectance spectrum
In figure \ref{fig:ref}, we show the observed reflectance spectrum of \I based on our visible spectrophotometry.
The reflectances at the central wavelength of the $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands, 
$R_r$, $R_i$, and $R_z$, were calculated as follows \citep[e.g.,][]{DeMeo2013}:
\begin{eqnarray}
    R_r &= 10^{-0.4[(r-g)_{\mathrm{3I}}-(r-g)_\odot]}, \\
    R_i &= 10^{-0.4[(i-g)_{\mathrm{3I}}-(i-g)_\odot]}, \\
    R_z &= 10^{-0.4[(z-g)_{\mathrm{3I}}-(z-g)_\odot]}, 
\end{eqnarray}
where 
$(r-g)_\mathrm{3I}$, $(i-g)_\mathrm{3I}$, and $(z-g)_\mathrm{3I}$ 
are colors of \I,
whereas
$(r-g)_\odot$, $(i-g)_\odot$, and $(z-g)_\odot$ 
are colors of the Sun in the Pan-STARRS system.
We adopted solar magnitudes of $g = 5.03$, $r = 4.64$, $i = 4.52$, and $z = 4.51$ from
\citet{Willmer2018}, and assumed an uncertainty of 0.02 in each.
The reflectance spectra in figure \ref{fig:ref} are normalized at the band center of $g$ band in the Pan-STARRS system, 0.4849~$\mu$m \citep{Willmer2018}.
Horizontal bars in \I's spectrum indicate filter bandwidths.
The calculated reflectance values are $R_r$ of $1.215\pm0.047$, $R_i$ of $1.320\pm0.064$, and $R_z$ of $1.454\pm0.074$.
In figure \ref{fig:ref}, Mahlke templates of S-, D-, and Z-type asteroids \citep{Mahlke2022} are shown for comparison.
The reflectance spectra other than \I are renormalized at the $g$ band center.
We found that the spectrum of \I appears similar to that of D-type asteroids.

Our $r-i$ color index of \I is consistent with that reported in \cite{Bolin2025_3I}.
However, discrepancies exist in the $g-r$, $i-z$, and $r-z$ color indices, which differ from those in \citet{Bolin2025_3I} 
at the 2$\sigma$, 1$\sigma$, 1$\sigma$ levels, respectively.
%\cite{Belyakov2025_3I} reported a visible reflectance 
%spectrum of \I, which is similar to that of 2I/Borisov \citep{deLeon2020}.
%Since our colors of \I are redder than the spectrum of 2I/Borisov in \cite{deLeon2020}, 
%our colors also does not match with the spectrum in \cite{Belyakov2025_3I}.
In contrast, our visible reflectance spectrum, which indicates a D-type asteroid surface, is in good agreement with the results presented by \citet{Seligman2025_3I}, \citet{Opitom2025_3I}, and \citet{Marcos2025_3I},
as well as the simultaneous spectrophotometry by \citet{Seligman2025_3I}.
The discrepancy in visible colors have previously been reported for 1I/`Oumuamua \citep{Meech2017, Jewitt2017, Bannister2017}.
\citet{Bannister2017} interprets that the discrepancy indicates a potential surface color change.
Simultaneous spectrophotometry is a reliable method to measure the accurate colors, minimizing the effects of rotational variability and atmospheric changes.
Given that two independent simultaneous spectrophotometry, this study and \citet{Seligman2025_3I}, yield consistent red, D-type-like spectra, 
we consider our results to be reliable despite challenging observing conditions, including the bright Moon and the low galactic latitude.
Further characterizations of 3I/ATLAS, especially prior to its perihelion passage in October 2025, will be essential to verify these results and investigate physical properties of the interstellar object.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}
We obtained simultaneous visible spectrophotometry of 3I/ATLAS using Seimei/TriCCS on July 15, 2025, when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance of 4.03~au.
The resulting lightcurves exhibit no significant brightness variation over a 2.3-hour time span, consistent with previous reports.
We derived color indices for 3I/ATLAS of 
\gr, \ri, and \rz in the Pan-STARRS system,
suggesting that the surface color of 3I/ATLAS closely resembles that of typical D-type asteroids.
Further monitoring observations of 3I/ATLAS, 
especially before its perihelion passage in October 2025, will be essential to validate these results and to gain deeper insight into the physical properties of the interstellar object.
